## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Harpeet Kaur, a Computer Science student, future full-stack dev & cybersecurity wizard 🧙‍♂️💻  
This challenge marks the beginning of my 19th year — I’m taking this seriously because I want to *build*, *earn*, and *grow*.

## 🔥 Why This Challenge?

Because waiting for life to “get better” is boring.  
I’m turning 19, and I want to make sure my actions reflect where I want to go 

This 4-week sprint is just the beginning of everything.
